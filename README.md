# d3force

## Description

Using d3force to see if I can make a reasonable family tree layout.

## To do

- Look to see if explicitly setting the y positions of the nodes is better than letting the force layout do it.
- Make an invisible node between parents and children to make the links more straight.
- Add year scale to side.
- Scale by dob properly.
